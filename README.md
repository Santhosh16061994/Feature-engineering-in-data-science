### What is feature engineering in data science?


Feature engineering refers to manipulation — addition, deletion, combination, mutation — of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy. Effective feature engineering is based on sound knowledge of the business problem and the available data sources.

Feature engineering is the process of creating new features (also known as variables or predictors) from existing data that can improve the performance of a machine learning model. In Python data science, feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, and combining variables to create new features that can better represent the underlying patterns in the data and improve the predictive accuracy of a model.

Some common techniques used in feature engineering include:

1. Imputation: filling in missing values in the data using statistical methods or other techniques.

2. Encoding: converting categorical variables into numerical variables that can be used in machine learning algorithms. Common methods include one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binary encoding.

3. Scaling: transforming numerical variables to a common scale to reduce the impact of variables with different units or magnitudes. Common methods include min-max scaling, standard scaling, and robust scaling.

4. Feature selection: selecting the most relevant variables to use in a model and removing irrelevant or redundant variables that can add noise or decrease performance.

5. Feature extraction: creating new variables by combining or transforming existing variables, such as creating polynomial or interaction terms.

*Overall, feature engineering is an important step in the data science pipeline and can have a significant impact on the performance of machine learning models. It requires a combination of domain knowledge, statistical analysis, and programming skills to effectively engineer useful features from the data.
